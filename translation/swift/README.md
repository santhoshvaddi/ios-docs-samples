# Cloud Translation gRPC Swift Sample

This app demonstrates how to make gRPC connections to the [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to get the translated text.

To call the APIs from iOS, you need to provide authorization tokens with each request for authentication. To get this token, this sample uses a Firebase Function (in Node.js) to generate these tokens on the behalf of a service account.

## Prerequisites

- An OSX machine or emulator
- [Xcode 10][xcode] or higher
- [Cocoapods][cocoapods] 

## Setup

- Create a project (or use an existing one) in the [Google Cloud Console][cloud-console]
- Enable the [Translate API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/translate.googleapis.com)
- Enable the [IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com).
- [Enable billing][billing]
- [Create a Service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) with the following IAM roles: `Cloud Translation API Editor` and `Storage Object Admin`. Example name: `translation-glossary`. ([For more info on: how to add roles to a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource))
- Go to  [GCP Storage console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/) tap on create a new bucket and follow the instructions.
- Upload the `Translation-glossary.csv` on your GCP storage's newly created bucket (example .csv file can be find in this `ios-docs-samples/Translation/swift/` directory to test the glossary feature in this sample). 
- Be sure that you have gone through the steps to use the glossary feature in this sample by [Create glossary](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/glossary#create_a_glossary) on your cloud.

###  Setup the app
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ios-docs-samples.git` 
- `cd ios-docs-samples/translation/swift/` 
- Run `./INSTALL-COCOAPODS` to install app dependencies (this can take few minutes to run). When it finishes, it will open the SpeechtoSpeech workspace in Xcode. Since we are using Cocoapods, be sure to open the `Translation.xcworkspace` and not `Translation.xcodeproj`.
- In Xcode's Project Navigator, open the `ApplicationConstants.swift` file within the `Translation` directory.
- Find the line where the `projectID` is set. Replace the `your-project-identifier` string with the identifier for your Google Cloud Project.
- Find the line where `glossaryID` is set. Replace the `your-glossary-id` string with the glossary id which you have created above.
- Go to the project editor for your target and then click on the Capabilities tab. Look for Push Notifications and toggle its value to ON

###  Setup Firebase on the application:

- Complete the steps for [Add Firebase to your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app) and expand the "Create a Firebase project" section for instructions on how to add project to your Firebase console. Note: No need to complete any other sections, they are already done. 
- Complete the steps to [Configuring APNs with FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs).
- Use `iOS bundle ID` which has push notifications enabled and select your development team in 'General->Signing' before building the application in an iOS device.
Note: as we were going to get the token in notifications, Please run the sample in iOS device instead of running it in the simulator. 
- In the [Firebase console][Firebase], open the "Authentication" section under Develop.
- On the **Sign-in Methods** page, enable the **Anonymous** sign-in method.

###  Setup and Deploy the Firebase Function 
The Firebase Function provides auth tokens to your app, You'll be using a provided sample function to be run with this app.

- Follow the steps in this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) for: 
- "1. Set up Node.js and the Firebase CLI"
- "2. Initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions". 
- Replace `index.js` file with the [provided index.js](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/master/functions/tokenservice/functions/index.js).
- Replace scope in line 79 with `scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],`
- Open `index.js`, go to function "generateAccessToken", and replace “SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com” with your Service account name (`translation-glossary`) and project id. 
- Deploy getOAuthToken method by running command:
```
firebase deploy -—only functions
```
- For your "App Engine Default Service Account" add the following IAM role: `Service Account Token Creator` . ([For more info on: how to add roles to a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource))

- For more info please refer (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started).

## Run the app

- You are now ready to build and run the project. In Xcode you can do this by clicking the 'Play' button in the top left. This will launch the app on the simulator or on the device you've selected. Be sure that the 'Translation' target is selected in the popup near the top left of the Xcode window. 
- By tapping on the Menu button in top left corner of the application, where the user can select source and target languages from the picker view.
- By tappng on Glossary button in top right corner of the application, where the user can enable or disable the glossary.
- Tap the `Type your input` text field. This sends the text to the TextToTranslationService class, which sends it to the Translation Service. Once the response `TranslateTextResponse` comes, The viewcontroller extracts translated text  from it and displays it on the screen.
- Right side will be the users query where as the left side will be translated response. 
- The chosen options will be stored in the user defaults for subsequent visits, and the fields will be repopulated.
